function [grRules,rxnGeneMat,indexes2check] = standardizeGrRules(model,embedded)
% standardizeGrRules
%   Standardizes gene-rxn rules in a model according to the following
%       - No overall containing brackets
%       - Just enzyme complexes are enclosed into brackets
%       - ' and ' & ' or ' strings are strictly set to lowercases
%
%   A rxnGeneMat matrix consistent with the standardized grRules is created.
%
%   model        a model structure
%   embedded      TRUE if this function is called inside of another 
%                RAVEN function, default FALSE
%
%   grRules      [nRxns x 1] cell array with the standardized grRules
%   rxnGeneMat   [nRxns x nGenes]Sparse matrix consitent with the
%                standardized grRules
%   
%   If this function is going to be used in a model reconstruction or
%   modification pipeline it is recommended to run this function just
%   at the beginning of the process.
